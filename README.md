This is the code/sketch to load on the board a
[GenuLog Data Acquisition, Signal Processing Shield](https://www.tindie.com/products/conciseusa/genulog-data-acquisition-signal-processing-shield/)
has been mounted to.

Even if you don't have the shield, you can add a RTC and an LCD to an Arduino and make you own data logger.
